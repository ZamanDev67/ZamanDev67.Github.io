He has been a TA for an undergraduate design studio, Structural Design, and Digital Media courses. Alongside Gabe Colombo, Nima hosts a biweekly GSD radio show called (im)material that interviews faculty and students on spirituality and the sacred in architecture. He served as the representative for the GSD on the Harvard Graduate Council and as the Chair of Information on the Executive Board of the council.

              Outside of his work in architecture, Nima is interested in playing piano, philosophy, geopolitics, flags, cars, calligraphy and (basic) Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. He speaks fluent Farsi and is actively trying not to forget the French he learned in high school.
